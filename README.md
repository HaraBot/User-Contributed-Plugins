# User-Contributed-Plugins
This is the main plugin repo for the Discord bot [Hara](https://github.com/HaraBot/Hara).

The purpose of this repository is to collate official and non-official plugins into one place for searching and grouping.

## How to submit a plugin

Your plugin must be submitted in its own Directory and not take the place of someone else's plugin - common sense people!

Upon submission you will have to run through a checklist (you'll see this when you submit a PR too).
It is as follows:
 - [ ] Plugin has been tested with the latest version of Hara.
 - [ ] Version tested with MUST be in the PR message.
 - [ ] Contains all required conf.yml keys (check example plugin).
 - [ ] Has a plugin.onEnable(function) callback (disable not required, but good to have).
 - [ ] Proper code formatting and good practices employed.
